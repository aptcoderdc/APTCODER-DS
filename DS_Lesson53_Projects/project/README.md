
# Analyzing Energy Consumption Patterns

## Overview

This project analyzes historical energy consumption data to identify patterns, trends, and seasonal variations. It also uses predictive modeling to forecast future energy consumption.

## Concepts Covered

- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Predictive Modeling
- Linear Regression
- Model Evaluation Metrics (Mean Squared Error, R-squared)

## Required Libraries

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Setup

1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
  
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

## How to Run

Open the project directory in VS Code.

Create a new Python file, e.g., energy_consumption_analysis.py.

Copy and paste the following code into the file:

Run the file by opening the terminal in VS Code and typing:

python energy_consumption_analysis.py

Review the output in the terminal to see the model's performance metrics.
