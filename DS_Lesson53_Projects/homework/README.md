
# Optimizing Energy Usage

## Overview

This homework assignment extends the project by incorporating weather data and identifying opportunities for optimizing energy usage through data analysis.

## Concepts Covered

- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Predictive Modeling
- Linear Regression
- Model Evaluation Metrics (Mean Squared Error, R-squared)
- Energy Usage Optimization

## Required Libraries

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Setup

1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

## How to Run

Open the homework directory in VS Code.

Create a new Python file, e.g., energy_usage_optimization.py.

Copy and paste the following code into the file:

Run the file by opening the terminal in VS Code and typing:

python energy_usage_optimization.py

Review the output in the terminal to see the model's performance metrics and the optimization opportunities.
