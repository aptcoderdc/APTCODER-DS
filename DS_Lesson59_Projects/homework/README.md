
# Quantum Data Simulation and Analysis

## Overview

This project simulates a quantum system by applying a sequence of quantum gates to an initial quantum state. The goal is to analyze the resulting quantum state and understand the effects of different quantum gates.

## Concepts Covered

- Quantum Gates (Hadamard, Pauli-X, Pauli-Z)
- Quantum State Simulation
- Visualization of Quantum Amplitudes

## Required Libraries

- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy

## Setup

1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   
   pip install numpy matplotlib scipy

## How to Run

Open the project directory in VS Code.

Create a new Python file, e.g., quantum_data_simulation.py.

Copy and paste the following code into the file:

Run the file by opening the terminal in VS Code and typing:

python quantum_data_simulation.py

Review the bar plot to understand how different quantum gates affect the quantum state.
