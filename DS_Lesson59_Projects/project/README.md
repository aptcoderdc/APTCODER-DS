
# Analyzing Quantum State Data

## Overview

This project involves analyzing quantum state data to understand superposition phenomena. Students will generate quantum states based on varying parameters and visualize their real and imaginary components.

## Concepts Covered

- Quantum States
- Superposition
- Visualization of Complex Numbers

## Required Libraries

- numpy
- matplotlib

## Setup

1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   
   pip install numpy matplotlib

## How to Run

Open the project directory in VS Code.

Create a new Python file, e.g., quantum_state_analysis.py.

Copy and paste the following code into the file:

Run the file by opening the terminal in VS Code and typing:

python quantum_state_analysis.py

Review the plots to understand the effects of superposition on quantum states.
