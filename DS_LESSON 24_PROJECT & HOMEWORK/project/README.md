Player Behavior Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze player behavior using data collected from a gaming platform. By exploring various metrics such as playtime, levels completed, and preferred characters, we gain insights into player engagement and preferences.

## Concepts Covered
Data Exploration
Data Visualization
Descriptive Statistics

## Required Libraries
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn

## Setup
Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

Place the player_data.csv file in the project directory.

## How to Run
Open the terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the Python script player_behavior_analysis.py:

python player_behavior_analysis.py

## Project Structure
