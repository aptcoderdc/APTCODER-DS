Disease Prediction System

## Overview
This project aims to develop a disease prediction system using machine learning techniques. The system predicts the likelihood of a patient having a particular disease based on their age, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and gender.

## Concepts Covered
Data preprocessing
Machine learning model training (Random Forest Classifier)
Model evaluation
Label encoding for categorical variables
Data splitting for training and testing

## Required Libraries
pandas
scikit-learn

## Setup
Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas scikit-learn

## How to Run
Place your dataset file named patient_records.csv in the project directory.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the Python script:

python disease_prediction_system.py

## Output
The script will output the accuracy score and a classification report, which includes precision, recall, F1-score, and support metrics for each class.
