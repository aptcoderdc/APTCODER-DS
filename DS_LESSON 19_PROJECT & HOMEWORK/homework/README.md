Understanding Healthcare Data Visualization

## Overview
This homework focuses on understanding healthcare data through visualization techniques. It aims to explore the distribution of patient data attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and disease status using histograms and pie charts.

## Concepts Covered
Data exploration
Data visualization using histograms and pie charts
Summary statistics

## Required Libraries
pandas
matplotlib

## Setup
Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas matplotlib

## How to Run
Place your dataset file named patient_records.csv in the project directory.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the Python script:

python healthcare_data_visualization.py

## Output
The script will display four subplots visualizing the distribution of age, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and disease status in the dataset. It includes histograms for numerical attributes and a pie chart for disease status distribution.
