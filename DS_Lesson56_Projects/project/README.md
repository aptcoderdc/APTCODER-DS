
# Analyzing Brain Activity Data

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing simulated brain activity data to identify patterns in brain waves and visualize them.

## Concepts Covered

- Data Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
- Brain Wave Patterns

## Required Libraries

- pandas
- matplotlib

## Setup

1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   
   pip install pandas matplotlib

## How to Run

Open the project directory in VS Code.

Create a new Python file, e.g., brain_activity_analysis.py.

Copy and paste the following code into the file:

Run the file by opening the terminal in VS Code and typing:

python brain_activity_analysis.py

Review the output to see the brain wave patterns over time.
