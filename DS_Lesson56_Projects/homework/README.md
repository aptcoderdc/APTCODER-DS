## Overview

This homework assignment involves predicting future brain wave patterns using an expanded dataset and understanding how different factors influence brain activity.

## Concepts Covered

- Data Preprocessing
- Predictive Modeling
- Linear Regression
- Model Evaluation Metrics

## Required Libraries

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## Setup

1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

## How to Run

Open the homework directory in VS Code.

Create a new Python file, e.g., brain_wave_prediction.py.

Copy and paste the following code into the file:

Run the file by opening the terminal in VS Code and typing:

python brain_wave_prediction.py

Review the output to see the performance metrics for each model.

## Expected Output

The terminal will display the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) values for each type of brain wave (Alpha, Beta, and Gamma). These metrics will help you understand how well each model is predicting brain wave patterns.
