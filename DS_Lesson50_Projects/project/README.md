# Quantum Teleportation Protocol

## Overview
This project focuses on simulating the quantum teleportation protocol using Python. Quantum teleportation allows the state of a qubit to be transferred from one location to another without physically moving the qubit.

## Concepts Covered
- Quantum Superposition
- Quantum Entanglement
- Quantum Teleportation

## Required Libraries
- numpy

## Setup
1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Install the required library using pip:
   
   pip install numpy

## How to Run
Open the project directory in VS Code.

Create a new Python file, e.g., quantum_teleportation.py.

Copy and paste the code into the file:

python quantum_teleportation.py

Review the output in the terminal to see the teleported state.
