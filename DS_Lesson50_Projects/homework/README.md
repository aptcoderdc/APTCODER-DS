# Quantum Key Distribution (BB84 Protocol)

## Overview
This homework assignment involves implementing the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol using Python. BB84 is a protocol used for secure communication.

## Concepts Covered
- Quantum Key Distribution
- Quantum Superposition
- Quantum Measurement

## Required Libraries
- numpy

## Setup
1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Install the required library using pip:
   
   pip install numpy

## How to Run
Open the homework directory in VS Code.

Create a new Python file, e.g., bb84_protocol.py.

Copy and paste the code into the file:

python bb84_protocol.py

Review the output in the terminal to see the generated key.
