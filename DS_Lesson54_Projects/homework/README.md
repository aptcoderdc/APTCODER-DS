## Overview

This homework assignment involves predicting network performance issues based on historical data and suggesting improvements. It includes data preprocessing, regression modeling, and prediction.

## Concepts Covered

- Data Preprocessing
- Linear Regression
- Prediction and Model Evaluation

## Required Libraries

- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Setup

1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
  
   pip install pandas scikit-learn

## How to Run

Open the homework directory in VS Code.

Create a new Python file, e.g., network_performance_prediction.py.

Copy and paste the provided code into the file.

Run the file by opening the terminal in VS Code and typing:

python network_performance_prediction.py

Review the output in the terminal to see the model's performance metrics and predictions.
