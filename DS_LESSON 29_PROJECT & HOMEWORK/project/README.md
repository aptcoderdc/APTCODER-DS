Project: Time Series Analysis of Monthly Temperatures

## Overview
In this project, students will learn how to perform basic time series analysis by exploring monthly temperature data. They will visualize the data, recognize patterns, and calculate basic statistics.

## Setup

Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas matplotlib

## Run the Project

Save the dataset content into a CSV file (monthly_temperatures.csv for the project).
Save the respective Python code into a .py file.
Run the script in a terminal or command prompt:

python project_time_series_analysis.py  # for the project

## Output

The script will display a time series plot of the temperatures.
The console will print basic statistics (mean and median) and the seasonal mean values.
