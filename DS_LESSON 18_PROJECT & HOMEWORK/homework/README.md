Team Statistics Dashboard with Machine Learning Concepts

## Overview
This homework involves creating a team statistics dashboard using machine learning concepts. The dataset contains information about teams' performance, including wins, losses, goals for, goals against, and points. We will calculate descriptive statistics for wins, visualize the data using a bar chart, and train machine learning models to predict points based on other team statistics.

## Concepts Covered
Data loading and preprocessing using Pandas
Descriptive statistics calculation (mean, median, mode)
Data visualization using Matplotlib (bar chart)
Machine learning modeling using Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest Classifier)
Model evaluation metrics (Mean Squared Error, Accuracy)

## Required Libraries
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

## Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
Place the team_statistics.csv dataset file in the project directory.

## How to Run
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the Python script team_statistics_dashboard.py.

python team_statistics_dashboard.py
