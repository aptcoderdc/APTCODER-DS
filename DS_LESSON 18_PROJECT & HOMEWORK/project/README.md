Player Performance Analysis with Machine Learning Concepts

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the performance of players using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains information about players' age, height, weight, and performance scores. We will explore the data, calculate descriptive statistics, visualize the distribution of performance scores, and train machine learning models to predict performance scores based on players' attributes.

## Concepts Covered
Data loading and preprocessing using Pandas
Descriptive statistics calculation (mean, median, mode)
Data visualization using Matplotlib (histogram)
Machine learning modeling using Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest Classifier)
Model evaluation metrics (Mean Squared Error, Accuracy)

## Required Libraries
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

## Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
Place the Player_Performance.csv dataset file in the project directory.

## How to Run
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the Python script player_performance_analysis.py.

python player_performance_analysis.py
