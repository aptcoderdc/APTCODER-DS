# Linear Regression Analysis Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates linear regression analysis to predict student scores based on their study hours.

## Concepts Covered
- Loading and preprocessing data
- Visualizing data relationships
- Implementing linear regression
- Evaluating model performance
- Visualizing regression results

## Required Libraries
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Setup
1. Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

2. Download the dataset `student_scores.csv`.

## How to Run
1. Place the `student_scores.csv` file in the same directory as the Python script.
2. Run the Python script `linear_regression_analysis.py`.

## Output
The script will display:
- Scatter plot showing the relationship between study hours and scores.
- Regression line fitted to the data.
- Mean Squared Error and R^2 Score of the linear regression model.
- Prediction for future scores based on study hours.
