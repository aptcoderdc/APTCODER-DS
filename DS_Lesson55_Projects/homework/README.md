## Overview

This homework assignment involves predicting the potential locations of ancient settlements using a more complex dataset. It includes data preparation, model building, and evaluation.

## Concepts Covered

- Data Preparation
- Linear Regression
- Model Evaluation Metrics (Mean Squared Error, R-squared)

## Required Libraries

- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Setup

1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   
   pip install pandas scikit-learn

## How to Run

Open the homework directory in VS Code.

Create a new Python file, e.g., predict_ancient_settlement.py.

Copy and paste the homework code into the file.

Run the file by opening the terminal in VS Code and typing:

python predict_ancient_settlement.py

Review the output and performance metrics in the terminal.
