This project focuses on analyzing survey data to identify patterns in personality traits. The project involves data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Concepts Covered
- Data Preprocessing
- Predictive Modeling
- Logistic Regression
- Model Evaluation Metrics (Classification Report)

## Required Libraries
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Setup
1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   
   pip install pandas scikit-learn

## How to Run

Open the project directory in VS Code.

Create a new Python file, e.g., personality_traits_analysis.py.

Copy and paste the following code into the file:

Run the file by opening the terminal in VS Code and typing:

python personality_traits_analysis.py

Review the output in the terminal to see the model's performance metrics.
