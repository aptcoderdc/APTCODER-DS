# Analyzing the Relationship Between Stress Levels and Psychological Factors

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing survey data to explore the relationship between stress levels and psychological factors such as anxiety, depression, and sleep quality. The project involves data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Concepts Covered
- Data Preprocessing
- Linear Regression Modeling
- Model Evaluation Metrics (Mean Squared Error, R-squared)
- Coefficient Analysis

## Required Libraries
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Setup
1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   
   pip install pandas scikit-learn

## How to Run

Open the project directory in VS Code.

Create a new Python file, e.g., stress_analysis.py.

Copy and paste the following code into the file:

Run the file by opening the terminal in VS Code and typing:

python stress_analysis.py

Review the output in the terminal to see the model's performance metrics and the coefficients of the model.
