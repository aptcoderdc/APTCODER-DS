# Breast Cancer Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Overview
This repository contains Python code for building a classification model to predict breast cancer using the Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn. The classification algorithm used in this project is Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel.

## Dataset
The Breast Cancer dataset is a classic and widely used dataset for machine learning. It contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The features describe characteristics of cell nuclei present in the image. The dataset contains a total of 569 instances and 30 numeric attributes. It is available as part of scikit-learn's datasets module.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Installation
You can install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib



## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the code files.
3. Run the `breast_cancer_classification.py` file using Python:
python breast_cancer_classification.py


4. The script will load the Breast Cancer dataset, preprocess the data, train a Support Vector Machine classifier, make predictions on the test set, evaluate the model's performance, and print the results.
