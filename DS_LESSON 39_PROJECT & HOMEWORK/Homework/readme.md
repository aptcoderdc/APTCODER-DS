# Predicting Soil Moisture Levels

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to use data science techniques to predict soil moisture levels based on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and soil type. Predicting soil moisture is crucial for efficient irrigation management and ensuring optimal crop growth.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:
1. **Data Acquisition**: Creation of a sample dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and converting categorical data to numeric.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data to understand patterns and correlations.
4. **Modeling**: Building and evaluating a linear regression model.
5. **Optimization and Prediction**: Using the model for predictions and optimization of soil moisture.
6. **Conclusion**: Summarizing findings and future work.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```sh
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
Running the Project
Clone the repository or download the project files.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the Python script:
sh

python soil_moisture_prediction.py
Code Overview
Data Acquisition
A sample dataset is created directly within the script using pandas DataFrame.

Data Preprocessing
Fill missing values using forward fill method.
Convert soil type to categorical and then to numeric using one-hot encoding.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize data relationships using pair plots.
Compute and visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap.
Modeling
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a linear regression model using the training data.
Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score.
Optimization and Prediction
Use the trained model to predict soil moisture levels based on new input conditions.
