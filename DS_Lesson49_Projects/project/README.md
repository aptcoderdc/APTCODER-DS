# Analyzing Air Quality Data

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing air quality data to understand pollution levels and identify patterns over time. The project involves data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Concepts Covered
- Data Preprocessing
- Predictive Modeling
- Linear Regression
- Model Evaluation Metrics (Mean Squared Error, R-squared)

## Required Libraries
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Setup
1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   
   pip install pandas scikit-learn

## How to Run
Open the project directory in VS Code.

Create a new Python file, e.g., air_quality_analysis.py.

Copy and paste the code into the file:

python air_quality_analysis.py

Review the output in the terminal to see the model's performance metrics.
