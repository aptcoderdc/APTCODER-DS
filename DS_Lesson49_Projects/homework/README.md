# Predicting Future Air Quality Levels

## Overview
This homework assignment involves predicting future air quality levels using a more complex dataset and understanding the impact of various factors. The assignment covers data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Concepts Covered
- Data Preprocessing
- Predictive Modeling
- Linear Regression
- Model Evaluation Metrics (Mean Squared Error, R-squared)

## Required Libraries
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Setup
1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   
   pip install pandas scikit-learn

## How to Run
Open the homework directory in VS Code.

Create a new Python file, e.g., future_air_quality_prediction.py.

Copy and paste the code into the file:

python future_air_quality_prediction.py

Review the output in the terminal to see the model's performance metrics.
