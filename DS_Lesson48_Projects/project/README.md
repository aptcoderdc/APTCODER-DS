# Predictive Analytics for Diabetes Diagnosis

## Overview
This project focuses on using predictive analytics to build a basic model for diagnosing diabetes. The project involves data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Concepts Covered
- Data Preprocessing
- Predictive Modeling
- Logistic Regression
- Model Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall)

## Required Libraries
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Setup
1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn


Certainly! Here are two README.md files, one for the project and one for the homework. You can place these files in the respective directories for each assignment in VS Code.

## How to Run

Open the project directory in VS Code.

Create a new Python file, e.g., diabetes_prediction.py.

Copy and paste the code into the file:

Run the file by opening the terminal in VS Code and typing:

python diabetes_prediction.py

Review the output in the terminal to see the model's performance metrics.
