
# Analyzing Flight Data for Safety and Efficiency

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing flight data to enhance safety and efficiency by detecting anomalies and optimizing fuel consumption. It covers data preprocessing, anomaly detection, and predictive modeling.

## Concepts Covered

- Data Preprocessing
- Anomaly Detection
- Linear Regression
- Model Evaluation Metrics (Mean Squared Error)

## Required Libraries

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## Setup

1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
  
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

## How to Run

Open the project directory in VS Code.

Create a new Python file, e.g., flight_data_analysis.py.

Copy and paste the following code into the file:

Run the file by opening the terminal in VS Code and typing:

python flight_data_analysis.py

Review the output in the terminal to see the model's performance metrics and detected anomalies.
