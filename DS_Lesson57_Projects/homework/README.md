
# Predicting Flight Delays Using Historical Flight Data

## Overview

This project involves predicting flight delays based on historical flight data. The analysis includes data preprocessing, building a Random Forest classification model, and evaluating its performance.

## Concepts Covered

- Data Preprocessing
- Classification Modeling
- Model Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Classification Report)
- Feature Importance

## Required Libraries

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## Setup

1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

## How to Run

Open the project directory in VS Code.

Create a new Python file, e.g., flight_delay_prediction.py.

Copy and paste the following code into the file:

Run the file by opening the terminal in VS Code and typing:

python flight_delay_prediction.py

Review the output in the terminal to see the model's performance metrics and feature importances.
