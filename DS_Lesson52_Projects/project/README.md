- Model Evaluation Metrics (Mean Squared Error, R-squared)
- Data Visualization

## Required Libraries
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Setup
1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
  
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

## How to Run
