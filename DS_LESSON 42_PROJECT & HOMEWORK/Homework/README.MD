# Robot Obstacle Avoidance System

This project implements a simple robot obstacle avoidance system using sensor data and a machine learning model. The system uses simulated ultrasonic sensor data to train a Random Forest classifier that predicts whether there is an obstacle based on the sensor readings. The trained model is then used to control the robot's movements in real-time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - joblib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
Project Structure
main.py: The main script that includes all steps from data collection to model deployment.
sensor_data.csv: The CSV file containing the collected sensor data (generated by the script).
Steps
1. Data Collection
The script simulates data collection from an ultrasonic sensor, recording distance readings and labeling them as 'Obstacle' if the distance is less than 30.0 cm or 'No Obstacle' otherwise. The data is saved to sensor_data.csv.

2. Data Preprocessing
The script loads the collected data from sensor_data.csv, encodes the labels ('Obstacle' as 1 and 'No Obstacle' as 0), and separates the data into features and labels.

3. Model Training
The script splits the data into training and testing sets, trains a Random Forest classifier, evaluates the model's accuracy, and saves the trained model to obstacle_avoidance_model.pkl.

4. Model Deployment
The script loads the trained model and simulates real-time obstacle avoidance by predicting whether a given distance reading indicates an obstacle and printing the corresponding action.

Usage
Run the script to perform all steps from data collection to model deployment:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
The script will output the model's accuracy and simulate the robot's obstacle avoidance behavior in real-time.
