# Content-Based Movie Recommender System

This is a simple Python script that demonstrates how to build a content-based movie recommender system using the pandas library.

## Overview

The content-based movie recommender system suggests movies to users based on the similarity between movie descriptions. It calculates the similarity between movies using TF-IDF vectors and cosine similarity.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
Usage
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/content-based-recommender.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd content-based-recommender
Run the Python script:

python content_based_recommender.py
Enter the title of the movie for which you want recommendations when prompted.
Sample Dataset
The script uses a sample dataset of movies with the following attributes:

title: Title of the movie
genre: Genre of the movie
director: Director of the movie
description: Brief description of the movie
You can replace this dataset with your own dataset for different movies.

Final Notes
Feel free to modify and extend the code as needed. This script serves as a basic example of building a content-based recommender system for movies.
