# Data Science in Transportation: Analyzing Traffic Patterns and Transportation Efficiency

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of data science techniques in analyzing traffic patterns and optimizing transportation routes for efficiency. It includes steps for data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), building a traffic prediction model, route optimization using Dijkstra's algorithm, and evaluation/validation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/transportation-data-science.git

markdown
Copy code
2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt



## Usage
1. Generate synthetic traffic data by running the `generate_traffic_data.py` script.
2. Execute the main analysis and modeling script `analyze_traffic.py`.
3. View the results and visualizations.
4. Modify the code as needed for your specific data and requirements.
