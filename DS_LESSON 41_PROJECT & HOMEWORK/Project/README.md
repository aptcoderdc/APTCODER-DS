# Machine Learning Project: Decision Trees, Random Forests, and SVMs

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines (SVM) for a simple classification task. The task involves predicting whether a person is likely to purchase a product based on their age and salary.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required Python libraries if not already installed. You can install them using pip:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn



## Usage
1. Run the `main.py` script to execute the code.
python main.py


2. The script will generate synthetic data, visualize it, preprocess it, train decision tree, random forest, and SVM classifiers, and evaluate their performance.
3. You can modify the parameters, such as sample size or model hyperparameters, in the `main.py` script to experiment with different configurations.

## File Structure
- `main.py`: Main Python script containing the project code.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `requirements.txt`: File containing the required Python libraries.
