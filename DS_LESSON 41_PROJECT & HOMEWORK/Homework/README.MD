# Housing Price Prediction

This project demonstrates the implementation of regression models for predicting housing prices based on synthetic data.

## Features
- Generate synthetic data for housing prices prediction.
- Explore the dataset to understand its structure and relationships between features and target variable.
- Preprocess the data by splitting it into training and testing sets.
- Train and evaluate three regression models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regression
  - Random Forest Regression

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
3. Run the script `housing_price_prediction.py`.
4. The script will generate synthetic data, train regression models, and display evaluation metrics such as RMSE and R^2 score.

## File Description
- `housing_price_prediction.py`: Main Python script containing the implementation of regression models for housing price prediction.
- `README.md`: Documentation file explaining the project and its usage.
