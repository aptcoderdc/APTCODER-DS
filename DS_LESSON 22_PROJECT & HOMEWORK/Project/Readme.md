Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset using Python.

Dataset
The Iris dataset is a famous dataset in the field of pattern recognition and machine learning. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The target variable is the species of iris, which includes three classes: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
