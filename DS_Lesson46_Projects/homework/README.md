# Enhanced Crime Data Analysis with Forecasting and Anomaly Detection

## Overview
In this homework assignment, you will extend the previous project by adding crime forecasting for the next day and detecting anomalies in the crime data. You will generate random crime data, visualize the types of crimes, identify patterns, forecast future crimes, and detect unusual spikes in crime incidents.

## Concepts Covered
- Data Visualization
- Pattern Detection
- Crime Forecasting
- Anomaly Detection
- Feature Engineering

## Required Libraries
- Python Standard Library (no external libraries required)

## Setup
1. Ensure you have Python 2 installed on your system.
2. Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
3. Create a new directory for the homework and navigate into it.
