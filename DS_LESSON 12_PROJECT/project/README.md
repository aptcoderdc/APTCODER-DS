Project: Pattern Art Creation

## Overview
In this project, we'll use Python's Matplotlib library to create a simple artwork with patterns. The goal is to demonstrate how patterns can be generated programmatically and visualized using code.

## Concepts Covered
Generating patterns programmatically
Using Matplotlib to create visualizations
Customizing plots with titles, ticks, and limits

## Required Libraries
Matplotlib

## Setup
Ensure you have Matplotlib installed. You can install it using pip:

pip install matplotlib

## How to Run
Copy the provided code into a Python script file (e.g., pattern_art_creation.py).
Run the script using a Python interpreter.
The artwork will be displayed in a new window.
