Project: Clustering Animals 

## Overview
In this project, students will learn how to perform clustering using the K-Means algorithm. They will cluster different animals based on their features such as size, weight, and lifespan.

## Setup

Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

## Run the Project

Save the dataset content into a CSV file (animals.csv for the project).
Save the respective Python code into a .py file.
Run the script in a terminal or command prompt:

python project_animals_clustering.py  # for the project

## Output

The script will display a scatter plot showing the clusters of animals.
The console will print the data with the assigned cluster labels.
