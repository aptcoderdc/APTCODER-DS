# Data Exploration and Visualization Project

## Overview
This project explores a dataset containing student information and visualizes key variables such as grades, attendance, and extracurricular activities. It aims to provide insights into student performance and engagement.

## Concepts Covered
- Data loading and cleaning
- Data analysis (mean, median, mode, range)
- Data visualization (pie charts, bar charts)

## Required Libraries
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Setup
1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install required libraries using pip:
    ```
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
    ```

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Ensure that the dataset file `student_data.csv` is in the same directory as the Python script.
4. Run the Python script `data_exploration_and_visualization.py` in your preferred Python environment (e.g., VS Code).

## Additional Notes
- The project assumes that the dataset is clean and does not perform extensive data cleaning.
- Make sure to have the necessary permissions to install Python libraries and run Python scripts.
