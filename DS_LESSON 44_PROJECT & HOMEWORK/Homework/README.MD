Exoplanet Discovery Project
This project aims to identify potential exoplanets using machine learning techniques applied to synthetic exoplanet data.

Features
Generates a synthetic dataset containing information about exoplanets and non-exoplanets.
Performs basic data exploration and visualization.
Trains a Random Forest classifier to identify potential exoplanets.
Evaluates the model's performance using classification metrics.
Provides conclusions and suggestions for further improvements.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
Installation
Clone the repository or download the exoplanet_discovery.py file.
Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Usage
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing exoplanet_discovery.py.
Run the script using the command:

python exoplanet_discovery.py
Dataset
The synthetic dataset is generated directly within the code and includes columns such as star_temperature, exoplanet_radius, orbital_period, and semi_major_axis.

Model
A Random Forest classifier is trained on the synthetic data to classify potential exoplanets.

Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Conclusion
The project concludes with a summary of the model's performance and suggestions for further improvements.
